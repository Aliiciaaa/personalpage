# Welcome to my personal page!
PhD in Mathematics (advisor: [Luis Guijarro](https://verso.mat.uam.es/~luis.guijarro/index-esp.html)) at [Maths Department](https://verso.mat.uam.es/web/index.php/es/) in [Universidad Autónoma de Madrid](http://www.uam.es)

Born in Madrid in 1995, I studied my Bachelor (2013-2017) and Masters Degree (2017-2018) in Mathematics at Universidad Autónoma de Madrid.

During my PhD, I began working on collapse of sequence of Riemannian manifolds with sectional curvature totally bounded and the intermediate k-Ricci curvature. Later, I center my research on the Gromov's invariant Filling Radius and the reach (in the sense of Federer) of isometric embeddings into Wasserstein-type spaces. Moreover, I studied some applications of the Wasserstein distance as the problem of uniformly ditributing points on a compact manifold.

At the same time, I discovered Topological Data Analysis. 

**Research interests:** Metric Geometry. Optimal Transport. Applied Algebraic Topology. TDA (Topological Data Analysis).
