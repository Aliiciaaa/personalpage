# Welcome to my personal page!
PhD in Mathematics (advisor: [Luis Guijarro](https://verso.mat.uam.es/~luis.guijarro/index-esp.html)) at [Maths Department](https://verso.mat.uam.es/web/index.php/es/) in [Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid](http://www.uam.es)

**Research interests:** Metric Geometry. Optimal Transport. Applied Algebraic Topology. TDA (Topological Data Analysis). 

I work on collapse of sequence of Riemannian manifolds with sectional curvature totally bounded and the geometry of the space of the bounded functions of a compact Riemannian manifold.

Moreover, I have interest in Optimal Transport applied to goemetric problems and in Topological Data Analysis, a new and promissing field of data analysis.
