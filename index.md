# Welcome to my personal page!
Studying for a PhD in Mathematics (advisor: [Luis Guijarro](https://verso.mat.uam.es/~luis.guijarro/index-esp.html)) at [Maths Department](https://verso.mat.uam.es/web/index.php/es/) in [Universidad Aut칩noma de Madrid](http://www.uam.es)

Born in Ponferrada in 1998, I pursued my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from 2016 to 2020, followed by a Master's degree from 2020 to 2021 at the Universidad Aut칩noma de Madrid.

During my PhD, my research initially focused on manifolds without conjugate points and Riemannian submersions. Subsequently, I shifted my focus to studying the reach (in the sense of Federer) of isometric embeddings into Wasserstein-type spaces. Additionally, I explored applications of the Wasserstein distance, particularly in addressing the problem of uniformly distributing points on a compact manifold.

Throughout this period, I also delved into Topological Data Analysis.

**Research interests:**  Riemannian/Metric Geometry. Optimal Transport. Topological Data Analysis.
